# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Pet Food Analyzer
## 1. Product Overview
The Pet Food Analyzer is a web application designed to provide pet owners with a quick and objective analysis of pet food ingredients. The initial Proof of Concept (PoC) will focus on analyzing cat and dog food from a single, predefined online store. Users will submit a product link along with their pet's details (species, breed, age). The application will scrape the ingredients, send them to a Large Language Model (LLM) for analysis against a set of predefined rules, and return a simple "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" verdict with a concise justification. All analyses are saved to a user's private history for future reference.

## 2. User Problem
Pet owners are often skeptical about the quality of commercial pet food and find it difficult to decipher complex ingredient lists. They lack a simple, accessible, and objective tool to help them quickly determine if a particular food product is suitable for their pet's specific needs, leading to uncertainty and a time-consuming research process. This application aims to solve this by providing an immediate, AI-driven analysis from a simple product link.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- FR-01: User Authentication: The system shall require users to register and log in to use the application. There will be no guest access.
- FR-02: Data Input Form: The application shall provide a single, vertical form for users to input the Product URL, Product Name, Species (Cat/Dog), Breed (free text), Age, and optional "Additional Info".
- FR-03: Ingredient Scraping: The system shall attempt to automatically scrape the ingredient list from the provided product URL.
- FR-04: Manual Ingredient Input: If ingredient scraping fails, the system shall prompt the user to manually copy and paste the ingredients.
- FR-05: LLM Analysis: The application will use an LLM with a guided meta-prompt containing predefined rules (e.g., "grain is bad for cats") to analyze the ingredients.
- FR-06: Results Display: The analysis result shall be displayed on a dedicated page featuring a prominent "Recommended" or "Not Recommended" badge and a short, LLM-generated justification.
- FR-07: AI Disclaimer: A disclaimer stating that the analysis is AI-generated and not a substitute for professional veterinary advice must be visible on the results page.
- FR-08: Product History: All analyses must be saved to a user-specific "My Products" page.
- FR-09: Analysis Versioning: The system will store a version history of analyses for each unique product name when a user re-analyzes a product.
- FR-10: User Feedback Mechanism: A simple "thumbs up/down" feedback system will be present on the results page for the developer to privately assess the quality of the LLM's analysis.
- FR-11: Database: The application will use a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
- FR-12: Loading Indicator: The UI shall display a loading indicator (e.g., "Thinking...") while the LLM analysis is in progress.

## 4. Product Boundaries
### In Scope (PoC)
- Platform: Web application.
- Target Users: Logged-in cat and dog owners.
- Data Source: A single, predefined online store for product URLs.
- Core Functionality: User registration/login, product submission, LLM analysis, results display, and personal product history.

### Out of Scope (PoC)
- Mobile native application (iOS/Android).
- Support for analyzing products from multiple or user-defined online stores.
- Analysis for animals other than cats and dogs.
- Social features like sharing results or public product reviews.
- A user interface for comparing different versions of a product's analysis history.
- Advanced, structured analysis based on the free-text "Breed" field.

### Unresolved Issues
- Breed Analysis Strategy: A strategy for how the LLM will reliably use the unstructured, free-text "Breed" input has not been defined.
- History Versioning UI: The specific user interface for navigating and comparing different historical versions of an analysis has not been designed.

## 6. Success Metrics
- SM-01: Core Functionality Success Rate: The primary success metric is the percentage of users who can successfully complete the primary usage path: submitting the form, receiving a coherent analysis, and having the result saved to their history. Target: >95%.
- SM-02: Analysis Quality (Developer Metric): The ratio of "thumbs up" to "thumbs down" feedback received on analysis results. This will serve as a key internal indicator of the LLM's performance and the value of the analysis to the user.
- SM-03: User Engagement: The average number of products analyzed and saved per user. An increasing average indicates that users find the service valuable and are using it repeatedly.
